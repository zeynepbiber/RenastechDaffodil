    /* POM stands for Page Object Model that is a design pattern that helps us to reduce code duplication and maintain our codes.
    Basically with the help of page object model our codes look more organized and maintainable. We create separate packages and in those
    packages we create separate classes.For instance; we create separate classes for each page of the application and if we locate
     elements on main page of an application, I use main page class, and I locate the elements that are only main page of an application so
     if there is any change in the future(could be locator or methods) we can easily find the class and maintain it.*/

//What is Page Object Model ?

//    Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements.
//    It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
//
//    In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file.
//    Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements.
//    Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.
//
//    Helps with easy maintenance
//    Helps with reusing code
//    Readability and Reliability of scripts
